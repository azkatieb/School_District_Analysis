# **Module 4 School District Analysis Challenge**

## **Overview of Project:**
### **Purpose of the Analysis**
The purpose of this analysis was to take the previous data analysis of the school district's math and reading scores from each of the high schools in the district. The school board suspects that the 9th grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School may have been altered and they have asked us to replace all of the 9th grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School with a NaN designation. NaN refers to a designation of Not a Number - this allowed us to remove those scores from the analysis without affecting the results which could have happened if we have replaced all the scores with zeros. Once the Thomas High School's 9th grade scores have been removed and the remaining data is intact - the school board wanted us to re-run all of the district anaylsis we previously did and then see what impact the questionable scores may have had.
